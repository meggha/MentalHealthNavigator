## 💸Applications

We have combined multiple functionalities  into a single website with a user friendly chatbot. This website involves wellness features to help the users, a platform to connect, and a help-providing chatbot.

## 🛠Project Setup

Open the terminal and change directory to client:
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Then open another terminal window and type :
cd server
npm run devStart to start the backend server

## 💻Usage

1. <h3>Open two terminal windows:</h3>
  In Windows, press Windows + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
  In macOS/Linux, open your preferred terminal application.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  In both terminal windows, use the cd command to change directory to the root of your project folder. This folder should contain both client and server subdirectories.
3. Run the frontend:
  In one terminal window, type cd client and press Enter. This changes directory to the client subfolder.
  Then, type npm start and press Enter. This will start the frontend development server.
4. Run the backend:
  In the other terminal window, type cd server and press Enter. This changes directory to the server subfolder.
  Then, type npm run devStart and press Enter. This will start the backend development server.
5. Access the web app:
  Open a web browser.
  In the address bar, type http://localhost:3000. This opens the frontend app running on the development server.

Additional notes:

- The frontend app will automatically reload in the browser whenever you make changes to the code.
- You may see console messages related to the development process in both terminal windows.
- Remember to stop the servers (Ctrl+C in most terminals) when you're done to avoid resource usage.
